## Installation

Instructions on how to install and set up the project. Include any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be installed, as well as step-by-step instructions for getting the project up and running on a local machine.

To install Next.js, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.

3. Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```

4. Install Next.js as a project dependency by running the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install next
    ```

5. Next, you'll need to create a `pages` directory in the root of your project. This is where you'll define your Next.js pages.

6. Start the development server by running the following command:

    ```shell
    npx next dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server and you can access your application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

7. You can now start building your Next.js application by creating pages in the `pages` directory and adding components, styles, and logic as needed.

Remember to update any other dependencies or prerequisites specific to your project in the installation instructions.
